# Compare (eden)

## Descrption

Haoran is a "huge god" who loves C++ so much.One day he wants to implement a template function cmp which compares any type of two elements.</br>
Now he passes the mission to you all and hopes you can implement it and makes it suitable to compare any two int, double, float, char, string and any two same type of pointers.</br>
If the first parameter is equal to the second one, then return true, elsewise, false.</br>

You can be careful that:

1. When comparing two int, double, float, char*, string , you should compare their values.
2. When comparing two pointers, you should compare the values they point to.
3. the cmp function should always return a boolean value.
